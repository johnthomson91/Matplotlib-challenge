Observations
1)	Based on the data, Ramicane and Capomulin seem to be the best options for treatment. Their results across the board are consistently better than the rest of the drug treatments. 
2)	Use of Ketapril on the mice actually exacerbated the size of the tumor as evident in the mean and median size being larger than that of the placebo.
3)	There seems to be a positive correlation based on weight and tumor size, so obesity could be a leading contributor squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) which should be studied further.
